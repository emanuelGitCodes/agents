My name is Emanuel Cortes.
I'm a Applications Programmer 2, Computer Software Engineer and a Master Student.
I'm originally from Bayamón, Puerto Rico, but I moved to Saint Cloud, Florida in 2024.
I love all foods, particularly Tostones with some good Mayo-Ketchup.
I love to spend my time working out when I can or relaxing with my family and friends.
